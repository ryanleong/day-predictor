Format:
The data is in comma-separated value format, based on derived daily observations of a number of meteorological phenomena: the is a post on the LMS Discussion Forum describing how I generated this data.

Each file is a set of readings corresponding to a given day at a given weather station. The various field values are (in order):
 - The name of the station
 - The year in which the observation(s) took place
 - The month in which the observation(s) took place
 - The day of the month on which the observation(s) took place
 - The aggregated precipitation observed (in mm)
 - The minimum observed temperature (in degrees Celcius)
 - The maximum observed temperature (in degrees Celcius)
 - The average of the observed temperature readings (in degrees Celcius); if only one reading took place for a given day, this will be the same as the minimum and maximum temperature
 - The maximum recorded wind reading (in metres per second)
 - The minimum observed sky ceiling (in metres)
 - The maximum observed sky ceiling (in metres)
 - The average of the observed sky ceiling readings (in metres)
 - The minimum observed visibility (in metres)
 - The maximum observed visibility (in metres)
 - The average of the observed visibility readings (in metres)
 - The minimum observed dew point (in degrees Celcius)
 - The maximum observed dew point (in degrees Celcius)
 - The average of the observed dew point readings (in degrees Celcius)
 - The minimum observed barometric pressure, normalised to sea level (in hectopascals)
 - The maximum observed barometric pressure (in hectopascals)
 - The average of the observed pressure readings (in hectopascals)
 - The day of the week

Missing values are indicated with a question mark (?)
